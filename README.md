# Symplectic-RK-Methods
Here we will implement numerical ordinary differential equation solvers (N-ODEs). Specifically we will implement Symplectic Runge-Kutta methods and Runge-Kutta methods that solve real and imaginary equations. Also we will also have integration with the commonly used optimization package pytorch.

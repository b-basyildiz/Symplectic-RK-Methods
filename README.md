# Symplectic-RK-Methods
Here we will implement numerical ordinary differential equation solvers (N-ODEs). Specifically we will implement Symplectic Runge-Kutta methods and Runge-Kutta methods that solve real and imaginary equations. Also we will also have integration with the commonly used optimization package pytorch.

For an usage case of this package see [arXiv:2312.09218](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.09218). Here symplectic runge kutta methods were used to model the time-dependent evolution of a quantum system. This quantum system is determined by the Schr√∂dinger equation $i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}|\psi\rangle = H|\psi\rangle$.
